### Problem Domain Public Transport Solution

The problem I have identified is our broken public transport system especially in the metro rail sector and communication between metrorail itself and daily commuters. On a daily basis there are constant delays and cancellations of trains and for those who are not present at the station are not aware of any of these changes or announcements made.

The only current system of informing commuters is via announcements at the station itself, or via an sms system which you have to sign up for and twitter. The problem with these methods of informing commuters is that not all changes and updates are sent through via sms and not everyone especially your elderly folks do not have access to or owns a twitter account.

I would like to develop a system/ mobile application where commuters are able to get live updates on any changes, delays, cancellations and extended travel times of trains directly from their mobile devices wherever they may be and have access to the app. They should also be able to check and view the timetable of trains for the day. So that they can plan their day better and make use of alternate transport if necessary before it is too late.

The aim of this solution is to try and provide commuters the necessary information needed so that they can plan better and save many a lot of time and money.
